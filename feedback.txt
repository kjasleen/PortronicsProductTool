files\\accounts\\AccountName\\sites\\sitename\\




I have to write a nodejs program for the following description.
This app would pick up files in the specified folders and based on the folders search these files in a certain table in a postgre DB, If there is no reference in the DB, then remove these files from the folder.
Now the specifics
The base folder will be configurable
The path after that would look like
basefolder\\files\\accounts\\AccountName\\sites\\sitename\\
 There are going to be multiple accounts with different AccountName in accounts folder
There are going to be multiple sites with different sitename in sites folder
We have to go thru the accounts one by one, and then in the account each site one by one

Under each site there may be all or some of the following folders

photographSets
qa
structuralReports
	technicalDocuments
	Under structuralReports there is technicalDocuments (Exception)
audit
ma
msTowerSets
leaseInformation
planningInformation
drawingSets
ram

We have to go through each of file/folder present in each of these folders, form a path with sub folders and filename and then look in the respective table and field I will specify later. If the path is not found in the table then write log 
and remove that file from the disk.
For the initial program  we will comment the deleting part , till the program stabilizes.
